# Jak-3-Satellite-Game
Minigame from a PS2 game called Jak 3 code in Python. Playable on PC

This project comes from a minigame of a PlayStation 2 game called “Jak 3”. This minigame is called “Satellite Game” and you can find videos in YouTube if you search this: “Jak 3 Satellite Game”.

The game is quite simple: at the start, there are 4 circles moving from the center of screen to the 4 edges. Shapes are falling from the edges to the center of the screen: 
  • Green triangles from the top 
  • Pink squares from left 
  • Red circles from right 
  • Blue crosses from the bottom

The player scores points whenever he clicks on the right controller button when the corresponding shapes overlaps with the circles. When the player hits the shape, it disappears. When the player hits several shapes at the same time, he scores more: 
  • 1 shape at a time = 1 point 
  • 2 shapes at a time = 5 points 
  • 3 shapes at a time = 10 points

When the player clicks on a controller button by mistake, meaning when there is no corresponding shape overlapping a circle, it increases by 1 the number of allowed “Misses”.

When a shape reaches the center of the screen and the player couldn’t hit it in time, it counts as a miss too. The goal of the left is simply the number of points to reach to win the game.
You can play this game by using the keyboard arrows.
